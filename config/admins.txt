#This is the file you modify if you want to make yourself an admin.
#The available ranks can be found in /proc/rank_to_level().
#Most of the time, you'll want to make yourself a Coder.
#To do so, type your BYOND key with no spaces or capitals, a dash with spaces on both side, then the rank you want.
#For example, the key "ZeWaka" would be given Coder rank like this: zewaka - Coder

elanoots - Coder
