Sweet water that comes in three easy steps:<br>
1.    Start by cooking drunken yellow-green gas mixed with black gold at an uncomfortably high temperature, add something to help the mixture breathe.<br>
2.    Next add the basics of table salt and water, but mix up the ingredients, add water.<br>
3.    Top it off with water, stir.
