Report from Robert G Baker, MD<br>
The damn med student just about froze to death today. They were trying to make some fancy drink and dumped the cryo tube mix in their bottle.
Took us a whole hour to chip them out of that ice cube. Still, she said it was just about perfect. Maybe she was on to something?
