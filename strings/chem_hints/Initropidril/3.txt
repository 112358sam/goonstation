Doctor Jacobs, you have to understand. We are aware of the risks. But this, well, it's the greatest discovery of our decade. The mysteries it presents, they stand to... to enrich our understanding of the universe. The problems it could solve, well, where do I begin? No-one would have to be sick. No-one would have to suffer ever again. It must be kept here. We must continue our research. If it escapes, what data we have gathered will be worth the price in lives we will pay. For god's sake, Jacobs, it makes... synthesises chemicals from nothing! It makes some sort of organic neurotoxin which damages brain tissue and leads to unconsciousness. It makes this out of nowhere. We don't feed it, but it keeps creating these chemicals- that should be a violation of so- so many principles, Jacobs, but it's happening right before my very eyes. The implications of this, well... you realise that this could make us rich, right? It could make us famous, we would go down in history. We would be the researchers who solved the one universal problem of the human condition... the researchers who solved death.
