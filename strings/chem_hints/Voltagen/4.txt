power generation is always so similar.<br>
In the old days we burnt coal, heating water to spin turbines.<br>
We moved to nuclear, heating water to spin turbines.<br>
We moved to wind, using nature to spin turbines<br>
We moved to hydroelectric, using gravity to spin turbines<br>
and now we sit in the space age, burning gasses to spin turbines
