You find an old document. It has CLASSIFIED stamped on it in several places. After years of experimentation we have finally developed a strain of orange trees that produce what we need. No longer will we have to keep that thing in captivity for harvesting. Order us a large shipment of vodka mixer and then we can increase grog production tenfold by next quarter!
